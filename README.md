## Problems: 
1. CSS Grid is missing some property, does not cover whole page: Fixed
2. Fontsize for the content is too small: Fixed
3. Absolute footer position is overlapped by CSS grid when there are more rows: Parked
4. Header does not highlight the active link; Need to active for the current page.

## Enhancements:
1. Authors - Authors shall be registered users but with isAuthor flag set to True; Only the authors shall be displayed on the author page. 
2. Registered users can lend a book only if the shelf has a copy of the book available. 
3. Registered users can add a book if they like and also can delete the ones they have added. 
4. Admin user or Super user can add/remove a user/book from the admin panel.
5. Registered user can view their profile and can make themselves author at any time. 
6. Author can't be a user if there are books linked to him/her. Books must be deleted first.

## Static File structure
For each apps, static files resides insides the static/app/ folder. For example, the css files for accounts app shall be available in accounts/static/account/css/signup.css
'collectstatic' will collect all files from these apps and will put them in project static folder. This is only for deployment but a good practise. 
STATIC_ROOL = 'static', collectstatic will put all static files in here.
